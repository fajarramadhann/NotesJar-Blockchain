When conducting audits of smart contracts, focus on the following key components:

1. **Code Quality**:
    
    - **Readability**: Ensure the code is well-structured and commented for clarity.
    - **Modularity**: Check if the code is organized into reusable functions and contracts.
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
    
    - **Reentrancy**: Look for functions that call external contracts and ensure they are protected.
    - **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Verify the use of libraries like SafeMath to prevent these issues.
    - **Access Control**: Ensure that sensitive functions are protected with proper access control mechanisms.
3. **Business Logic**:
    
    - **Correctness**: Confirm that the contract's logic aligns with the intended functionality.
    - **Edge Cases**: Test how the contract behaves under unusual or unexpected conditions.
4. **Gas Efficiency**:
    
    - **Optimization**: Identify areas where gas consumption can be reduced, such as minimizing storage operations and avoiding excessive loops.
5. **Event Emission**:
    
    - **Logging**: Ensure that important state changes and actions are logged through events for transparency and tracking.
6. **External Calls**:
    
    - **Safety**: Review any calls to external contracts for potential risks, ensuring proper checks are in place.
7. **Testing and Coverage**:
    
    - **Unit Tests**: Check for comprehensive unit tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases.
    - **Test Coverage**: Ensure that a high percentage of the code is covered by tests.
8. **Upgradeability**:
    
    - **Proxy Patterns**: If applicable, review the upgradeability mechanisms to ensure they are secure and well-implemented.
9. **Compliance and Standards**:
    
    - **ERC Standards**: If the contract is a token, ensure it adheres to relevant ERC standards (e.g., ERC20, ERC721).
10. **Documentation**:
    
    - **Clarity**: Ensure that the contract is well-documented, including its purpose, functions, and any known limitations.
